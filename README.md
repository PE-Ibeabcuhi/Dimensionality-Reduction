### UNDERSTANDING DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

This project identifies regions with similar weather conditions by analyzing monthly recorded data from April to September. By using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, we uncover patterns and clusters within the data.

The visualizations produced by PCA and UMAP helps reduce the complexity of the dataset, making it easier to identify regions with similar weather conditions based on multiple metrics. These insights can be valuable in various business applications, such as targeting markets with similar characteristics, optimizing supply chains, and tailoring marketing strategies to specific regional weather patterns.
